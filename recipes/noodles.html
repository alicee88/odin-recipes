    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I usually make these noodles at least once a week. They're quick, easy, delicious, and a great way to use up anything you might have in the fridge.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>For two people, here's what you'll need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 packs of noodles (I like egg or udon noodles but any will do)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of peanut oil</li>
        <li>A handful of greens (e.g. spinach or little gem lettuce</li>
        <li>4 chopped spring onions or a sliced whole onion </li>
        <li>2 cloves of sliced garlic</li>
        <li>A couple of handfuls of protein (e.g. tofu, sliced pork, minced beef, beaten egg)</li>
        <li>A tablespoon of soy</li>
        <li>A teaspoon of chilli oil</li>
        <li>A pinch of sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a pan of water to the boil for the noodles</li>
        <li>Whilst they're cooking, heat up a wok and add the peanut oil</li>
        <li>Fry the protein until it's browned and smelling good</li>
        <li>Throw in the onions and garlic and fry until they're soft and a bit translucent</li>
        <li>Add the soy sauce, chilli oil, and sugar</li>
        <li>Add the noodles and mix everything together</li>
        <li>Serve and eat immediately!</li>
    </ol>
